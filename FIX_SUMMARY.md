# Google OAuth Fix Summary

## Issue
The "Continue with Google" button on the login page was not responding when clicked. No redirect to Google's OAuth page occurred.

## Root Cause
The application was missing the required Supabase environment variables in the `.env.local` file. Without these credentials, the Supabase client could not initialize the OAuth flow properly.

## Solution
Created a `.env.local` file with the following environment variables:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://znildkucbbehfydowzvr.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6InpuaWxka3VjYmJlaGZ5ZG93enZyIiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJpYXQiOjE3NjA4Njc2MzQsImV4cCI6MjA3NjQ0MzYzNH0._uxdLUZQjWYd_bFatyaQWfdjE13t7Pb_TVCCeTxLjxQ
```

These credentials were retrieved from the Supabase project using the Supabase MCP integration.

## Steps Taken
1. Cloned the `sports-buddy` repository from GitHub
2. Identified the missing environment variables
3. Used Supabase MCP tools to retrieve the project URL and anonymous key
4. Created `.env.local` file with the correct credentials
5. Restarted the Next.js development server to load the new environment variables
6. Tested the "Continue with Google" button - it now successfully redirects to Google's OAuth page

## Verification
The button now works correctly and redirects users to:
`https://accounts.google.com/v3/signin/identifier` with the proper OAuth parameters.

## Important Notes
- The `.env.local` file is gitignored by default (as it should be)
- For production deployment, ensure these environment variables are set in your hosting platform (Vercel, Netlify, etc.)
- The `.env.example` file already exists in the repository as a template for other developers
